# jekyll api

I wish I had an API for updating my Jekyll blog, which is hosted on GitHub
pages.

I don't *mind* using Git to update it, but it would be cool if I didn't have
to.

I made a proof of concept version in January 2014, which I wrote [a blog post][]
about. That version is browseable at [this tag][]. I'm sort of tempted to make
this a more generally useful thing (that version would have only worked for
me).

[this tag]: https://github.com/maxjacobson/jekyll_api/releases/tag/v0.1.0

Here's the vision: https://github.com/maxjacobson/jekyll_api/issues/1
